Multiple plugins with the same name 'aksynthone' (found at 'Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/Windows/x86/DSP/AkSynthOne.dll' and 'Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/Windows/x86_64/DSP/AkSynthOne.dll'). That means one or more plugins are set to be compatible with Editor. Only one plugin at the time can be used by Editor.
